# Answer a series of questions

##### 1. Take a look at a fairly complicated recipe website. Using a tool of your choice, analyze/diagram what their site map and information architecture looks like. Obviously, I donâ€™t expect you to go down to the individual recipe level, but be sure to show how the site you choose breaks down their recipes into categories and at least 1 sub-category.


The website I've chosen is https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/228823/quick-beef-stir-fry/, which aims to teach people how to prepare beef stir fry. When visiting the website, you'll notice a navigation menu at the top that guides users to select categories of interest. Additionally, the website presents hyperlinks for dish names, ratings, and images to provide a quick introduction to the featured dish.

Furthermore, the site offers an overview of the dish and outlines potential challenges that individuals may encounter during the cooking process. It provides a detailed list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions for preparation.

Towards the end, user reviews of those who have attempted the recipe are included, along with related dishes. The footer section also contains information about the website's parent company.

Basically, the structure is:

1. **Navigator:**
   - Appetizers
   - Main Courses
   - Desserts
   - Beverages
   - Special Diets (e.g., Vegan, Gluten-Free)
   - Cuisine (e.g., Italian, Mexican, Indian)
   - Occasions (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas)
2. **Sub-Categories:**
   - Under "Main Courses," you might have sub-categories like:
     - Beef
     - Chicken
     - Seafood
     - Vegetarian
   - Under "Cuisine," you could have sub-categories like:
     - Italian
       - Pasta
       - Pizza
       - Risotto
     - Mexican
       - Tacos
       - Enchiladas
     - Indian
       - Curries
       - Tandoori
   - Under "Special Diets," you might include sub-categories like:
     - Vegan
       - Vegan Breakfast
       - Vegan Desserts
     - Gluten-Free
       - Gluten-Free Baking
       - Gluten-Free Pasta
3. **Recipe Detail Pages:**
   - Each recipe would have its own detail page with the recipe name, ingredients, cooking instructions, and user reviews.
   - There might be additional sections for nutritional information, preparation time, and difficulty level.
   - Users can navigate to a recipe's detail page by selecting a category, sub-category, and then choosing a specific recipe.
4. **Search and Filter Functionality:**
   - The website would likely offer search and filtering options to allow users to find recipes based on keywords, ingredients, dietary preferences, and more.
   - Users can refine their search results using criteria such as cooking time, calorie count, or ratings.
5. **User Interaction and Community Features:**
   - Users might have the option to save their favorite recipes, leave comments, submit their own recipes, and rate dishes.
   - There may be a discussion forum or a section for tips and tricks related to cooking.
6. **Additional Pages:**
   - About Us: Information about the website, its mission, and its team.
   - Contact Us: A way for users to get in touch with questions or feedback.
   - Blog: Articles on cooking tips, trends, and related topics.

##### 2.Read [this article](http://mediatemple.net/blog/tips/five-important-considerations-for-wireframing/?utm_source=weekly_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=aug17newsletter) on wireframing. Post a brief reaction in a markdown file in your repo.

These considerations include:

1. **Clarifying the Problem**: Understanding the problem thoroughly before diving into design work is crucial. Asking questions like what the project is, who it's for, and where it will be used helps create a better solution.
2. **Workflows and Sketches**: Sketching and mapping out workflows early in the design process can help identify critical questions and streamline the wireframing process.
3. **Getting Early Feedback**: Sharing your wireframe ideas with developers, designers, and product managers can help incorporate technical limitations and improve the overall design.
4. **Knowing Your Tools**: Becoming proficient with wireframing tools like Omnigraffle or others is essential for efficient and effective wireframing.
5. **Tailoring Wireframes to the Audience**: Adjusting the level of detail in wireframes to match the audience's needs, whether high-fidelity or low-fidelity, is important for effective communication.

Overall, these considerations emphasize the importance of careful planning, collaboration, and effective communication in the wireframing process in UX design.



##### 3.Using the recipe you uploaded last week _(or a new one)_ wireframe your desired layout for a single recipe page on your hypothetical recipe site. Think - rows, columns, sidebars, headers, footers etc. Be sure to mark up each block of content in your wireframe with a few HTML tags for practice.



##### 4.Mark up your recipe in HTML semantically based on your wireframe. Bonus points for applying some basic font and color styles.

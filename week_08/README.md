*Start thinking about how you can add a new JavaScript function to your Midterm Project. Keep in mind you will have to write a function from scratch. If you can not think of an application for your Midterm, you have to option to write a html/js page from scratch to accomplish your goal. If you write a new page, dont worry about CSS, just JS DOM interactivity/manipulation*

To enhance a portfolio website, I recommend implementing a "Filterable Project Gallery" using JavaScript. This feature allows visitors to easily browse and sort projects based on categories or tags, improving user experience. By creating JavaScript functions to dynamically filter and sort projects without page reloads, you can provide interactive buttons or dropdowns that allow users to select specific project categories. JavaScript can then hide or reveal relevant projects based on assigned tags or categories, accompanied by smooth transition animations. This dynamic project gallery adds a layer of interactivity and user-friendliness to your portfolio website, making it easier for visitors to find and explore the projects that interest them most.
